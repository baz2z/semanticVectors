# semanticVectors
A R-Script to predict reaction time in semantic priming tasks using semantic vectors. 
The euclidean distance of prime and target is calculated to then predict reaction time using linear regression.
The reaction time data is from the Semantic Priming Project and the semantic vectors are referenced in the pdf.
